This is a fork of tomcool420's Overflow plugin for the AppleTV2, it has been updated to work with Dustin Howetts latest beigelist, he appears to have changed some things since this actual release so I'm a bit tentative pushing out a new copy, however, the only thing that actually needs updating is the tweak that he started distributing separately, a bit after this was added to his git hub. I will inquire with him shortly about pushing an update and hopefully it will be one of the last things that needs to be upgraded for the 8F455.
